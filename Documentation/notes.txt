Refactoring goals:
	current system of actions and triggers does not allow any action or triggered action
		to be prevented by anything else

	movement actions require source tile to be passed in as well as target tile. this is
		because movement is just deleting the unit from the source tile and creating
		a copy at the target tile. 

	A lot of information is needing to be passed down in an unintuitive way. e.g. playerID
		is passed into hand constructor > passed into card constructors > passed into
		action constructor > passed into unit constructor, so that a unit can know who
		owns it


Need to put guards on all ranges/relevent so that trying to access tiles outside the map doesn't
	cause an error

Known error: A Commander being destroyed by a Guard Tower does not result in the game ending. I believe this is because the GT trigger is clobbering the Commander trigger.

DONE-\/
Needed implementation:
	It is possible for the game to result in a draw (if both commanders are fireballed, or if a commander moves into a defended tile to take the other commander). 
	Since we do not have any implementation in place to detect and report this, the way it is currently set up, 
		the player whose commander is destroyed first (in the fireball scenario, this is determined according to the order in which the fireball checks tiles) will lose.

	We may want an indicator that warns you when your commander is within the range of a fireball, and asks if you're sure you want to proceed since this at best will result in a draw
		(also we may want to nerf fireball since you can just yeet someone's commander once you get close enough 
		- I think Jigyas mentioned the possibility of not letting it target commanders at all).
